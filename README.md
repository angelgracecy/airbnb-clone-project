# Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project and how they contribute to the overall functionality of the platform.

👤 User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Hosts can list properties, while guests can browse and book properties. Secure authentication and role-based access control are implemented to ensure user data integrity.

🏘️ Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Listings include key details such as title, description, pricing, location, and photos, helping guests make informed booking decisions.

📅 Booking System
Facilitates property reservations by allowing users to select available dates and confirm bookings. It ensures date availability, prevents double bookings, and links each reservation to both the user and the property.

💳 Payment Processing
Handles the secure processing of booking payments. Integrates with payment gateways to charge users based on the property price and booking duration, while tracking the status of each transaction.

📝 Review System
Lets users leave feedback and ratings on properties they’ve booked. This helps maintain trust in the platform by highlighting user experiences and encouraging hosts to maintain high-quality listings.

📈 Data Optimization
Incorporates pagination, filtering, and search functionalities to improve data accessibility and platform performance. This ensures users can efficiently find properties that match their preferences.


# API Security
Security is a critical component of the Airbnb Clone project to ensure user trust, data protection, and safe transactions. The following key measures are implemented to secure the backend APIs:

🔑 Authentication
Authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. This project uses secure authentication methods (e.g., token-based authentication) to verify user identity during login and API access. It helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.

🛂 Authorization
Authorization controls what authenticated users are allowed to do. For example, only hosts can manage properties, and only the property owner can edit or delete a listing. This ensures that users can only perform actions they have permission for, protecting data integrity.

🚫 Rate Limiting
Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe. This helps prevent abuse such as brute-force login attempts or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, enhancing the reliability and stability of the platform.

🔒 Secure Payments
Payment endpoints are secured to protect sensitive financial data. This includes encrypting communication with HTTPS and validating payment requests to prevent fraud and unauthorized charges.

🧑‍💻 Data Protection
User data such as emails, passwords, and payment details are securely stored using encryption and hashing (e.g., bcrypt for passwords). This prevents data leaks and protects users in case of a breach.

Security is essential at every level of this project to maintain platform trust, protect users and hosts, and ensure safe, smooth operation.


#CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a set of practices that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. Whenever a developer pushes code to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline ensures that the code is automatically tested and, if it passes all checks, deployed to the production or staging environment.

Why CI/CD is Important
CI/CD helps maintain code quality, reduce manual errors, and speed up the release process. It ensures that new features, bug fixes, and updates are delivered reliably and efficiently. This is especially important for projects like this Airbnb Clone, where maintaining functionality, user experience, and uptime is crucial.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions – For automating workflows such as running tests and deploying code on every push or pull request.

Docker – For creating consistent and portable development and production environments.

Heroku / PythonAnywhere / AWS / Vercel – For deployment and hosting of the backend API and frontend (if applicable).

pytest / Django Test Suite – For running unit and integration tests as part of the pipeline.

CI/CD ensures that each code change is automatically verified and safely deployed, supporting an agile and scalable development process.
